# How to Make a Stablecoin on Kii Chain
This project is a practical guide to creating and testing an ERC20-based stablecoin on Kii Chain. The stablecoin created is called IDR and can be minted by anyone simply by entering a wallet address into the mint formâ€”no need for a wallet connection like Metamask.

The goals of this project are:
- Provide a real-world example of stablecoin creation on Kii Chain
- Demonstrate an open and transparent minting process
- Encourage other builders to experiment and contribute to the Kii ecosystem
